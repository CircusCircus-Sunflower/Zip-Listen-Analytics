# components
UI building blocks used across the dashboard.

Files of interest:
- PlotlyChart.js — wrapper for react-plotly.js
- ChartCard.js — consistent card container for charts/lists
- Header.js / FiltersPanel.js — Dashboard shell controls

Guidance:
- Small, focused components to make unit testing easier.
- Add PropTypes or TS interfaces when converting to TypeScript.
